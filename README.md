Project Objective: 
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a patient will survive one year after treatment. The project utilizes two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest

The accuracy of these models is evaluated using the F1 score, ensuring a balanced assessment of precision and recall.
